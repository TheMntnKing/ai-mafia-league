# Phase 10: 3D Replay Viewer (Roblox-Adjacent, Stylized Mesh)

**Goal:** Build a 3D voxel-style replay viewer using React Three Fiber that transforms game logs into cinematic, YouTube-ready content.

**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Phases 10.1-10.3 complete, 10.4-10.6 pending)

**Current phase:** 10.3 (Voting + Death) - mostly complete, needs runtime verification

**Scope:** Core viewer functionality (log playback, 3D scene, events visualization)

**Predecessor:** Phase 9 (2.5D CSS viewer) - ARCHIVED

See `docs/replay_vision.md` for visual style rationale and detailed specs.

## Locked Style Decisions

- **Visual target:** Roblox-adjacent, stylized plastic look (not full voxel).
- **Environment:** low-poly/blocky town square with clean materials and serious lighting.
- **Characters:** stylized mesh avatars with simple proportions and bold silhouettes.
- **Consistency rules:** unified palette, unified material model, consistent scale.

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Framework | React + Vite |
| 3D Engine | React Three Fiber |
| Helpers | @react-three/drei |
| State | Zustand |
| Animation | React Spring |
| Assets | fal.ai API (Hunyuan3D, Trellis 2) → .glb |

cd viewer
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei zustand @react-spring/three leva
```

---

## Architecture

**Log-driven:** Viewer consumes logs, doesn't simulate game rules.

**Default mode:** Omniscient. During development and content review, seeing all information
(roles, reasoning, Mafia coordination) is essential. Public mode exists for "mystery" YouTube
cuts but is secondary—most viewers want the full drama, not the puzzle.

```
Game Log (JSON) → Log Parser → Timeline Store (Zustand) → Scene Renderer (R3F)
```

## Asset Strategy (AI-Generated via API)

**Goal:** Fast iteration with a consistent, meme-friendly visual style.

**Style target:** Stylized plastic/low-poly town + stylized mesh characters (Roblox-adjacent).
Keep one palette, one material model, and consistent scale.

### Primary Tools (fal.ai Pay-Per-Use)

| Tool | Use Case | Cost | Link |
|------|----------|------|------|
| **Hunyuan3D v2** | Characters, complex props | ~$0.20-0.30/gen | [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/hunyuan3d/v2) |
| **Trellis 2** | Props, scene elements | $0.25-0.35/gen | [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/trellis-2) |

**Why API over SaaS subscriptions:**
- Pay-per-use (~$5-10 for all assets) vs $17+/month subscriptions
- Same underlying models
- No commitment, scale as needed

### Prompt Rules (Apply to All AI Assets)

**Characters (Hunyuan3D)**
- Style: "stylized plastic", "blocky", "toy-like", "clean silhouette"
- Proportions: big head, chunky limbs, minimal facial detail
- Materials: solid colors, no photo textures, no micro-detail
- Pose: A-pose for potential rigging
- Input: Reference image + style keywords (models don't know meme names)

**Props/Scenes (Trellis 2 or Hunyuan3D)**
- Style: low-poly, clean shapes, simple forms
- Materials: flat colors or minimal gradients, no noisy textures
- Modularity: separate props (lamps, benches, signs) for reuse

**Consistency Pass (Required)**
- Override all materials to the project palette in-engine
- Normalize scale (target ~1.7m for humanoid height)
- Center/pivot at feet for characters, base for props

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 10.0: Art Direction + Asset Plan

**Goal:** Lock the style and asset pipeline before heavy implementation.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Define a style bible (palette, materials, lighting rules, scale) in `docs/style_bible.md`
- [x] Lock AI tools (fal.ai: Hunyuan3D for characters, Trellis 2 for props)
- [x] Draft prompt rules for town assets + character silhouettes
- [x] Draft a town square blockout (houses, lamps, round table)
- [ ] Smoke test: generate 1 character + 1 prop via fal.ai, verify GLB loads in R3F

**Deliverable:** Style bible + AI prompt rules + blockout scene + verified pipeline.

**Status:** ⚠️ Mostly complete. Smoke test (fal.ai generation) pending.

---

### Phase 10.1: Foundation

**Goal:** Basic 3D scene that responds to log events.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Clean up `viewer/` - remove Phase 9 bloat
- [x] Install R3F dependencies
- [x] Create `Scene.jsx` with R3F Canvas
- [x] Create `Stage.jsx` with floor plane (town square placeholder)
- [x] Create `Character.jsx` rendering colored placeholders (meshes or cubes)
- [x] Create `Characters.jsx` positioning players in a semi-arc based on `log.players.length`
- [x] Create `gameStore.js`:
  - `log`, `eventIndex`, `playing`
  - `nextEvent()`, `prevEvent()`, `setIndex()`
- [x] Create `logParser.js` to extract timeline (handle `night_zero_strategy`: skip in public, short scene in omniscient)
- [x] Basic prev/next buttons
- [x] Load log via file input

**Deliverable:** N colored cubes. Stepping through events highlights active speaker.

**Status (code review 2025-01):** ✅ Store actions present. Private fields filtering logic verified. ⚠️ **Needs runtime testing**: day announcement replay prevention, event parsing edge cases.

---

### Phase 10.2: Camera + Speech

**Goal:** Cinematic camera and speech display.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `Camera.jsx` with drei's `PerspectiveCamera`
- [x] Camera presets:
  - Wide shot (all visible)
  - Speaker focus (zoom on active)
  - Vote tension (slow pan)
- [x] Animate transitions with React Spring
- [x] Create `Subtitles.jsx` for speech text
- [x] Create `Lighting.jsx`:
  - Day: warm directional + ambient
  - Night: cool blue + low ambient

**Deliverable:** Camera cuts to speaker. Subtitles show text. Day/night lighting works.

**Status (code review 2025-01):** ✅ Camera presets + transitions implemented. Lighting colors match style_bible. **Drifts**: Detective office missing desk lamp, vote pan constant speed. ⚠️ **Needs runtime testing**: camera focus accuracy, lighting during scene transitions.

---

### Phase 10.3: Voting + Death

**Goal:** Visualize votes and eliminations.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `VoteTokens.jsx`
- [x] Sequential vote reveal:
  - Delay between each vote (900ms per vote)
  - Running count display (e.g., "Bob: 3")
  - Vote chips show "Voter → Target" (2D overlay)
- [x] Death animation:
  - Sink below stage
  - Grayscale material
  - X eyes
- [x] Handle revote flow (round 2)
- [x] Defense banner overlay during defense events
- [x] Replay flow: night‑kill handled as target‑marking with day‑start announcement; camera focuses on night‑kill victim via day_announcement.
- [x] Investigation: reasoning shown as subtitles; target/result shown in banner.

**Deliverable:** Votes reveal one-by-one. Dead characters visually distinct.

**Status (code review 2025-01):** ✅ Vote sequence logic, death animation, overlay components implemented. ⚠️ **Needs runtime testing**: vote timing accuracy, death state transitions.

---

### Phase 10.4: Character Models (Stylized Mesh)

**Goal:** Replace placeholders with real character meshes.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Generate a base humanoid via fal.ai Hunyuan3D (blocky, stylized plastic)
- [ ] Create 3 initial hero characters via fal.ai:
  - Bombardiro Crocodilo (use reference image + style prompt)
  - Tralalero Tralala (use reference image + style prompt)
  - Generic humanoid (text prompt only)
- [ ] Apply unified materials/palette (override textures if needed)
- [ ] Download .glb files
- [ ] Model loading with `useGLTF`
- [ ] Hot-swap fallback: `MODELS[persona] || MODELS.placeholder`
- [ ] Simple idle animation (bobbing)

**Deliverable:** 3 character models, others placeholders. Dynamic loading works.

**Status:** ❌ Not started.

---

### Phase 10.5: Scenes + Modes

**Goal:** Scene variations and viewing modes.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create remaining character models
- [ ] Scene variations:
  - Day town square (warm)
  - Mafia lair (red, fog)
  - Detective office (blue/noir)
- [x] Scene switching based on phase
- [x] Scene roster filtering:
  - Mafia lair shows ONLY Mafia
  - Detective office shows ONLY Detective
  - Town square shows ALL living players
- [x] Night kill is a target-marking beat (no death yet)
- [x] Death animation triggers at day start after dawn/announcement
- [x] Public/Omniscient toggle (core):
  - Public: hide roles, reasoning, Mafia scenes
  - Omniscient: show everything
- [x] Character name labels (floating above head, always visible)
- [x] Role indicators (omniscient only):
  - Color-coded badge (red=Mafia, blue=Detective, gray=Villager) ✅ Implemented
  - Optional: role icon (gun, magnifying glass)

**Deliverable:** All characters modeled. Scene changes work. Mode toggle works.

**Status (code review 2025-01):** ⚠️ Partial. Scene switching logic, roster filtering implemented. ⚠️ **Needs runtime testing**: mode toggle behavior, scene visibility edge cases. Character models pending.

---

### Phase 10.6: Polish

**Goal:** Reasoning display and UI polish.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Reasoning display:
  - Background dims to 30%
  - Role-colored glow under character
  - Thought text overlay
- [ ] Reasoning heuristics:
  - Always: Detective
  - Day speech: Mafia (rotate if 3+)
  - Before defense: most nominated
- [ ] Timeline scrubber
- [ ] Phase markers (Day 1, Night 1)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (space, arrows)
- [ ] Performance optimization if needed

**Deliverable:** Full-featured viewer ready for content production.

**Status:** ❌ Not started.

---

## Known Issues / Remaining

**Pending tasks (Phase 10):**
- Character model pipeline (10.4)
- Scene environment detail: fog for Mafia lair, props for town square (10.5)
- Reasoning display rules: Detective always, Mafia pre‑speech, most nominated before defense (10.6)
- New logs with corrected last_words → elimination ordering

**Deferred to Phase 11 (Production Readiness):**
- TTS audio integration + sync
- Export/recording workflow
- Advanced animation (expressions, gestures)
- UI polish (summary, scoreboard, accessibility)

**Spec drifts (cosmetic):**
- `Camera.jsx`: Vote tension pan is constant speed (~40s orbit). Spec implies variable pacing for tension building—consider slowing as votes reveal.
- `game_end` event: No explicit handler in `usePlayback.js` or `findActiveSpeaker`—falls back to 2200ms (functional but implicit).

---

## File Changes

**Delete:**
- `viewer/src/App.jsx` (replace)
- `viewer/src/index.css` (replace with minimal)

**Keep:**
- `viewer/package.json` (update deps)
- `viewer/vite.config.js`
- `viewer/index.html`
- `viewer/public/`

**Create:**
- `viewer/src/stores/`
- `viewer/src/components/`
- `viewer/src/hooks/`
- `viewer/src/utils/`
- `viewer/src/assets/models/`

---

## Log Schema (v1.2)

Required fields:

```javascript
log.schema_version
log.game_id
log.timestamp_start
log.timestamp_end
log.winner
log.players           // [{seat, persona_id, name, role, outcome}]
log.events            // [{type, timestamp, data, private_fields}]

event.type            // "speech", "vote_round", "elimination", "night_kill", etc.
event.timestamp       // ISO8601
event.data.phase      // "day_1", "night_1", etc.
event.data.round_number
event.data.stage
event.data.state_public    // {phase, round_number, living, dead, nominated}
event.private_fields // list of data keys hidden in public mode
event.data.reasoning // present in omniscient view when not filtered
```

Notes:
- `state_before`/`state_after` live inside `event.data` for roster-changing events.
- Private reasoning is in `event.data.reasoning` and listed in `event.private_fields`.
- `vote_round` includes `data.round`, `data.outcome`, and `data.votes`.
- `vote_round.data.outcome`: `"eliminated"`, `"no_elimination"`, or `"tie"` (round 1 only).
- `elimination` includes `data.eliminated`.

**Reasoning payloads (viewer mapping):**
Use `thought` for internal monologue TTS (plays before spoken line) and `subtitle` for the
spoken line. Many events have no subtitle.

| event.type | thought source | subtitle source | notes |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| `speech` | `data.reasoning.reasoning` | `data.text` | `data.reasoning` is full `SpeakingOutput`. |
| `defense` | `data.reasoning.reasoning` | `data.text` | `data.reasoning` is full `DefenseOutput`. |
| `last_words` | `data.reasoning.reasoning` | `data.text` | `data.reasoning` is full `LastWordsOutput`. |
| `night_zero_strategy` | `data.reasoning.reasoning` | `data.text` | `data.reasoning` is full `SpeakingOutput` (night_zero context). |
| `vote_round` | `data.vote_details[<voter>].reasoning` | none | Per-voter `VotingOutput`. Use selectively. |
| `night_kill` | see notes | `proposal_details*[*].message` (optional) | Reasoning is a coordination bundle. |
| `investigation` | `data.reasoning.reasoning` | none | `data.reasoning` is full `InvestigationOutput`. |
| `elimination` | none | none | Use UI + day announcement, not log text. |

**Night kill bundle details:**
- Round 1: `reasoning.proposals` + `reasoning.proposal_details`
- Round 2: `reasoning.proposals_r1`, `reasoning.proposals_r2`,
  `reasoning.proposal_details_r1`, `reasoning.proposal_details_r2`, optional `decided_by`
- Each entry in `proposal_details*` is a full `NightKillOutput` (includes `message` and
  `reasoning`). Viewer must parse these; do not assume `data.text` exists.

Viewer should handle `vote_round` + `elimination` events (schema v1.2).

## Testing

1. Load sample log from `logs/`
2. Step through all events
3. Verify camera follows speaker
4. Verify sequential vote display
5. Verify death animation
6. Toggle modes, verify visibility

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 10 Complete When:

1. ✅ Loads any v1.2 game log
2. ⚠️ 7 characters rendered (3+ real models) - Partial (placeholders working, models pending)
3. ✅ Camera cuts to active speaker
4. ✅ Subtitles display speech
5. ✅ Votes reveal sequentially
6. ✅ Dead characters distinct (sink, grayscale, X eyes)
7. ✅ Day/night lighting works
8. ✅ Public/Omniscient toggle works
9. ❌ Reasoning displays for featured players (Phase 10.6)
10. ✅ Full game playback without errors

**Viewer Readiness after Phase 10:** ~60-70%
- **Good for:** Internal testing, debugging, log validation
- **Missing:** Audio, export workflow, advanced animation, UI polish
- **Next:** Phase 11 (Production Readiness) for YouTube content
