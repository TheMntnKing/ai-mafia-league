# AI Mafia Agent League - Vision

## What Is This

AI Mafia Agent League is an entertainment-first AI competition where autonomous agents play competitive Mafia against each other. Every game produces watchable content with hidden reasoning, strategic deception, and dramatic reveals.

## Why It Exists

### The Entertainment Gap

Existing "AI plays Mafia" content has problems:
- Dumb models repeat each other and create chaos
- Smart models play too obviously and get predictable
- Once you know each model's personality, games become boring
- No progression, no stakes, no reason to watch the next episode

We fix this by making games that are:
- Genuinely strategic (agents must reason, deceive, deduce)
- Consistently engaging (personas with distinct playstyles)
- Unpredictable (same agents can have different outcomes)
- Watchable (hidden thoughts create dramatic irony for viewers)

### The AI Competition Gap

Current AI benchmarks test models in isolation. Mafia tests something different:
- Theory of mind (what do others believe?)
- Deception (can you mislead while appearing honest?)
- Deduction under uncertainty (no confirmed information)
- Persuasion (can you shift votes?)
- Memory and pattern recognition (tracking behavior across rounds)

No leaderboard captures this. We create one.

## Target Audience

### Primary: YouTube/Content Viewers
- People who enjoy AI content and comparisons
- Mafia/social deduction game fans
- Want entertainment first, technical depth optional
- Care about personalities, drama, and surprising moments

### Secondary: AI Developers and Researchers
- Want to see how different architectures perform at deception and deduction
- Interested in submitting their own agent implementations
- Care about the competition and skill dimensions

## Core Principles

### Entertainment Over Optimization
A technically optimal but boring game is a failure. A suboptimal game with drama, betrayal, and surprise is a success. When in conflict, choose watchability.

### Competitive Integrity
Games must be fair. Same information available to all players at appropriate times. No model has hidden advantages. Skill should determine outcomes over many games.

### Transparent Reasoning
Viewers see what agents think, not just what they say. The gap between private reasoning and public speech is where drama lives.

### Authentic Mafia
We follow competitive Mafia rules, not simplified versions. No role reveals. Proper speaking order. Real strategic depth. This creates better games and respects the source material.

## What Success Looks Like

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Working game engine that runs complete games
- 7 agents with distinct personas
- Games are watchable and interesting
- First YouTube content published

### Phase 2: Content Series
- Regular episode releases
- Consistent personas that viewers recognize
- Tournament formats with stakes
- Growing audience

### Phase 3: Competition Platform
- Open submissions for agent architectures
- Ranked ladder
- Same base model, different reasoning strategies
- Architecture becomes the skill differentiator

## What This Is Not

### Not a Model Benchmark
We're not trying to prove Claude is better than Gemini. Different models may have different strengths, but the goal is entertainment and competition, not marketing.

### Not a Solved Game
Mafia has enough hidden information and social dynamics that optimal play doesn't exist. We're exploring how AI handles genuine uncertainty and deception.

### Not a Research Paper
Academic rigor is secondary to building something people want to watch. We'll learn things along the way, but publication isn't the goal.

## Long-Term Direction

The endgame is a platform where:
- Anyone can submit an agent architecture
- Agents compete in regular tournaments
- Skill is measured by win rate across many games
- The meta evolves as people discover better strategies
- Content is generated continuously from competitive play

The game rules stay fixed. The narrator stays fixed. The skill lives in how agents reason, remember, and deceive within those constraints.
