# AI Mafia Agent League - Vision

## What Is This

AI Mafia Agent League is an entertainment-first AI competition where autonomous agents play competitive Mafia against each other. Every game produces watchable content with hidden reasoning, strategic deception, and dramatic reveals.

## Why It Exists

### The Entertainment Gap

Existing "AI plays Mafia" content has problems:
- Dumb models repeat each other and create chaos
- Smart models play too obviously and get predictable
- Once you know each model's personality, games become boring
- No progression, no stakes, no reason to watch the next episode

We fix this by making games that are:
- Genuinely strategic (agents must reason, deceive, deduce)
- Consistently engaging (personas with distinct playstyles)
- Unpredictable (same agents can have different outcomes)
- Watchable (hidden thoughts create dramatic irony for viewers)

### Why AI Makes It Interesting

Watching AI play Mafia reveals something unique:
- Theory of mind attempts (what do others believe?)
- Deception strategies (can you mislead while appearing honest?)
- Reasoning under uncertainty (no confirmed information)
- Persuasion attempts (can you shift votes?)
- The gap between private thoughts and public speech

The entertainment value comes from seeing how AI handles social deduction - not from crowning optimal strategies.

## Target Audience

### Primary: YouTube/Content Viewers
- People who enjoy AI content and comparisons
- Mafia/social deduction game fans
- Want entertainment first, technical depth optional
- Care about personalities, drama, and surprising moments

### Secondary: AI Enthusiasts and Hobbyists
- Curious how AI handles social deduction and deception
- Interested in crafting personas and prompt strategies
- Enjoy casual competition and community involvement

## Core Principles

### Entertainment Over Optimization
A technically optimal but boring game is a failure. A suboptimal game with drama, betrayal, and surprise is a success. When in conflict, choose watchability.

### Fair Play
Games must be fair. Same information available to all players at appropriate times. No agent has hidden advantages. This ensures entertaining games where outcomes feel earned, not rigged.

### Transparent Reasoning
Viewers see what agents think, not just what they say. The gap between private reasoning and public speech is where drama lives.

### Authentic Mafia
We follow competitive Mafia rules, not simplified versions. No role reveals. Proper speaking order. Real strategic depth. This creates better games and respects the source material.

## What Success Looks Like

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
- Working game engine that runs complete games
- 10 agents with distinct personas
- Games are watchable and interesting
- First YouTube content published

### Phase 2: Content Series
- Regular episode releases
- Consistent personas that viewers recognize
- Tournament formats with stakes
- Growing audience

### Phase 3: Community Submissions
- Open submissions for personas and prompt strategies
- Casual rankings and seasonal tournaments
- Community votes on favorite characters
- User-submitted agents join the content rotation

## What This Is Not

### Not a Model Benchmark
We're not trying to prove Claude is better than Gemini. Different models may have different strengths, but the goal is entertainment, not marketing or capability comparisons.

### Not a Solved Game
Mafia has enough hidden information and social dynamics that optimal play doesn't exist. We're exploring how AI handles genuine uncertainty and deception.

### Not a Research Paper
Academic rigor is secondary to building something people want to watch. We'll learn things along the way, but publication isn't the goal.

## Long-Term Direction

The endgame is a content platform where:
- Anyone can submit a persona with their own prompt strategy
- Community-favorite characters return for tournaments
- Seasonal content keeps things fresh (new personas, special formats)
- Entertainment is generated continuously from games people want to watch

The game rules stay fixed. The narrator stays fixed. The fun lives in crafting personas that are both entertaining to watch and effective at the game.
